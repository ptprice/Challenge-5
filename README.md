# Project Title

Simple Task Board to keep track of To-Do Items in a columnar format. 

## Description

This website can be used to create, submit, track, and delete to-do tasks. When you open the website you see the columns To-Do, In Progress, and Done. There is a button at the top of the screen to add a task. 
The input for the task has a field for title, description, and a drop down picker for due date. Once all information is input you can submit which creates a card in the To-Do column by default. If you chose not to submit you can cancel from the task entry sub form. 

Once you have a card created it is listed with the title, description and due date. There is also a delete button at the bottom of the
card to remove that card. You can drag and drop any card from any column to any other column, depending on where you are in the process
of completing the task.
